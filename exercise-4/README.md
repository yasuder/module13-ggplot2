# Exercise 4

In this exercise you will be working with **ggplot2** and working with changing different information and aesthetics

You will be using housing information stored within the data directory in all of these charts.  Make sure you look through
what the information is that you are working with.  You do not need to commit this exercise so if you just copy and paste
it into an R file, make sure that you also grab the csv in the data file.
